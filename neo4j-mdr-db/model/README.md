## Models
To manage the complexity of the domain, we distinguish between four abstraction layers from a data model perspective:
- Conceptual model - how "manager"-level stakeholders view the data. (High-level)
- Domain model - how end-users perceive the data, for "user"-level conversations.
- Logical model -  how the front-end developers and other data consumers perceive the data.
- Physical model - how our API developers work with the data (as stored on disk in the database).

The models are created using a yEd editor from yWorks, it is suggested to use this software to view the models.
