# Control Terminology Model
At its core, Control Terminology provides a standardized set of values required for generating CDISC-compliant datasets. 
In our model, Control Terminology can also be extended with Sponsor defined values - in particular, Novo Nordisk specific naming for certain values.

The two main building blocks of control terminology are:
- **Terms**: standardized names for terminology used in a clinical context. E.g. "100mg/L", "Weight", "Intravenously".
- **Codelists**: groupings of terms that fit into the same category. E.g. "Dose Unit", "Dimension", or "Route of Administration".

Control Terminology items can be selected as part of library objects, like objectives and endpoints, but also dictionaries, assessments and other concepts.

A snapshot of the part of the data model concerning control terminology is shown below.

## Terminology
The following terminology is used for the control terminology as stored in the graph.

| Concept          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| Catalogue       | A control terminology catalogue containing a collection of codelists. Each incremental load of the new codelists is grouped as a package.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Package      |   A set of codelists loaded at a given point in time.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Package Codelist      | A codelist as present in a package. This is just a reference object, linking the package to the actual codelist.                                                                                          |
| Package Term | A term as present in a package. This is just a reference object, linking the package codelist to the actual term.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Codelist     | A group of terms of a given type. An example: `Anatomical Location`                                                                                                                                   |
| Term | A value that can be selected from a codelist. Examples: `Elbow, Hand, Leg`.                                                            |
| Codelist/Term Attributes       | Standard (CDISC) namings for control terminology codelists and terms.                           |
| Codelist/Term Name    | Sponsor-defined namings for control terminology, used in addition to the attributes. |


### Catalogues and Packages
Catalogues and packages are created by the CDISC import script on a schedule.
If the import script loads a catalogue that previously existed in the database, a new package is created.
A package therefore represents a snapshot of a CDISC release.

> The graph structure around packages (CTPackage, CTPackageCodelist, CTPackageTerm) do not hold data from the codelists/terms. These are stored seperately. The package structure simply acts as a reference tree, with links to the data nodes.

### Sponsor Defined & Non-Sponsor Control Terminology
We have split the Codelists and the Terms into two set of metadata: 
- Attribute values - metadata from the CDISC library, version controlled and grouped.
- (Sponsor-defined) name values - allowing a sponsor (e.g. Novo Nordisk) to provide a custom name for each codelist or term.

For a single codelist or term, the standard attribute values and sponsor-defined values are versioned seperately. This is also reflected in the graph.
> One CTCodelistRoot has exactly one CTCodelistAttributesRoot and one CTCodelistNameRoot. It can have multiple versions of both of these. The same applies to terms.

### Codelist Configurations
Codelist configurations are used to bind specific codelists to part of the study configuration.
For example, we might want to specify that codelist C43023 can be used to select objective types.
This configuration is versioned, and stored in the database.

There are two types of codelist configurations that are stored in the graph:
- `FieldNameConfig` - to define which codelist can be used to select a specific study field type.
- `SelectionRelTypeConfig` - to define which codelist can be used to select a specific study selection.

A seperate API endpoint is defined to create and update codelist configurations.

## Business Logic
Control terminology is created and updated either from the periodic import scripts, or from a set of API endpoints.
Terms and codelists can only be connected to other parts of the system if they are in a final released state.
