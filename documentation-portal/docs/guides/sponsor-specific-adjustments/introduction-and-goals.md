# Introduction and Goals

## Introduction

In addition to the CDISC defined controlled terminology, we maintain sponsor-specific names. See 
[this section](/guides/datamodel/physical/control-terminology.html#sponsor-defined-non-sponsor-control-terminology)
for more details.

## Goal

The goal is to initialize the sponsor-specific names of those codelists and terms that
have been created the first time (initial CDISC CT load).
