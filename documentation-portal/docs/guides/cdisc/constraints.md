## The CDISC-way of providing term submission values

CDISC is using a structure that does not clearly differentiate between the two term submission value types: `code` and `name` submission value.

In the MDR project, we need to have this differentiation. So decisions have been based on that differentiation and the transformation from the CDISC structure into our own structure.
