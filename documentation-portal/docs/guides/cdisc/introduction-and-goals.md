# Introduction and Goals

## Introduction

CDISC provides Controlled Terminology (CT) that shall be integrated into the MDR project / studybuilder application.

## Goals

The goal is to transform the CDISC CT structure into the structure we use in the MDR project.
See the section [Neo4j Control Terminology Model](/guides/datamodel/physical/control-terminology.html) for details on how this structure looks like.
