# Contributions

Contribution is very welcome. 

We are looking for example forward to the following contributions

- Feedback
- Join discussion and user group
- Feature and bug reporting
- Documentation / Training / Explanation contributions
- Additional components as standalone components
- In the future (2023/2024): coding contribution directly or through vendors

## General

Please get in touch with our team to provide feedback through 
[Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/openstudybuilder/shared_invite/zt-19mtauzic-Jvrhtmy7hGstgyiIvB1Wsw), E-Mail (OpenStudyBuilder@gmail.com) or at events or conferences 
([here](https://novo-nordisk.gitlab.io/nn-public/openstudybuilder/project-description/intro_events/) are upcoming events). We are very keen to enhance the OpenStudyBuilder. 
We are planning for regular updates on the OpenStudyBuilder coming from Novo Nordisk directly.

## Code contribution

Due to the complexity of this project, we do not accept source code contributions at this point in time. If you see valuable contributions on that level, please get in direct 
contact with us to discuss possible collaboration. We will work on processes for code contributions when we see an interest.

## Additional components

Due to the modular structure and API support of the OpenStudyBuilder it is highly encouraged to develop additional components. These could be hosted as stand alone
projects. We would love to link your components - so please get in touch.
