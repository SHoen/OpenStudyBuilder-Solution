State before:
 - a laboratory activity with uid must exist.

Business logic:
 - If parameter atSpecifiedDateTime is specified then the latest/newest representation of the concept at this point in time is returned. The point in time needs to be specified in ISO 8601 format including the timezone, e.g.: '2020-10-31T16:00:00+02:00' for October 31, 2020 at 4pm in UTC+2 timezone. If the timezone is ommitted, UTCï¿½0 is assumed.
 - If parameter status is specified then the representation of the concept in that status is returned (if existent). This is useful if the concept has a status 'Draft' and a status 'Final'.
 - If parameter version is specified then the latest/newest representation of the concept in that version is returned. Only exact matches are considered. The version is specified in the following format: <major>.<minor> where <major> and <minor> are digits. E.g. '0.1', '0.2', '1.0', ...

State after:
 - No change

Possible errors:
 - Invalid uid, atSpecifiedDateTime, status or version.

Business logic:

 - relationships to specified control terminology are created (as in the model).

 - The status of the new created version will be automatically set to 'Draft'.

State after:
 - laboratory-activities is created in status Draft and assigned an initial minor version number as 0.1.
 - Audit trail entry must be made with action of creating new Draft version.

 - Invalid library or control terminology uid's specified.
