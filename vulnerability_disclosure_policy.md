## Legal position

Novo Nordisk is committed to our responsibility for ensuring the safety and security of patients, healthcare professionals and customers who use our products. Novo Nordisk will not engage in legal action against individuals who in good faith submit vulnerability reports in accordance with our Vulnerability Disclosure Policy. We openly accept reports for the products and services, that is accompanied by the present vulnerability disclosure policy, from individuals who

* Engage in testing our products and/or research without harming Novo Nordisk or its customers
* Engage in vulnerability testing within the scope of our vulnerability disclosure program and avoid testing against products and/or services being actively used for patient care delivery, diagnostics or monitoring

## Scope

Always refer to the information provided with the specific products documentation, delivery or through other means (e.g. SECURITY.md files) provided as the scope takes precedence over the following scope.

### Prohibited testing methods

* Destructive testing such as DoS, excessive Fuzzing, bruteforce etc.
* Destructive injection techniques (e.g. if you find an injection vulnerability do not alter data but reflect `time` and `version` instead)
* Social Engineering

## Disclaimer
Novo Nordisk considers it a key priority to provide safe products and services including protecting personal information. Therefore, when conducting your security research, please avoid actions that could cause harm to patients or products. Note that vulnerability testing could negatively impact a product. As such, testing should not be conducted on active products used for medical treatment, and products subjected to security testing should not subsequently be used for medical treatment or in a clinical setting. If there is any doubt, please contact a Novo Nordisk representative. Contact information for a representative can be found in the [SECURITY.md](.SECURITY.md) file.  
Novo Nordisk reserves the right to modify its Vulnerability Disclosure Policy at any time, without notice, and to make exceptions to it on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed. However, if a vulnerability is verified by our global product security team, we will attribute recognition to the researcher reporting it, if requested.  
  
**CAUTION:** Do not include sensitive information (e.g., sample information, PHI, PII, etc.) in any documents submitted to Novo Nordisk. Comply with all laws and regulations in the course of your testing activities.  
  
By contacting Novo Nordisk, you agree that the information you provide will be governed by our site's Data Privacy Policy and Online Terms of Use.
 
**Note:** When sharing any information with Novo Nordisk, you agree that the information you submit will be considered non-proprietary and non-confidential and that Novo Nordisk is allowed to use such information in any manner, in whole or in part, without any restriction.
